Get started with AI-Shorts-Creator today and unlock the potential of your videos like never before!

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pytube` library (install with `pip install pytube`)
- `opencv-python` library (install with `pip install opencv-python`)
- `openai` library (install with `pip install openai`)
- `youtube-transcript-api` library (install with `pip install youtube-transcript-api`)
- FFmpeg (install according to your operating system)

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install FFmpeg by following the installation instructions for your operating system. Make sure the `ffmpeg` command is accessible from the command line.

3. Set up your OpenAI API key by replacing `openai.api_key = ''` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Modify the `video_id` variable in the `main()` function to specify the YouTube video you want to process.

5. Run the script:

```shell
python auto_cropper.py
```

The script will download the YouTube video, analyze its transcript using OpenAI's GPT-4, extract the best sections based on the analysis, crop the video using FFmpeg, and apply face detection using OpenCV to further refine the cropping.

## Additional Information

- The `download_video(url, filename)` function downloads a YouTube video by providing the URL and specifying the filename.
- The `segment_video(response)` function segments the video into interesting sections based on a transcript analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- The `detect_faces(video_file)` function uses face detection to identify faces in a video file.
- The `crop_video(faces, input_file, output_file)` function crops the video around the detected faces using FFmpeg.
- The `is_talking_in_batch(frames)` function analyzes the lip movement or facial muscle activity within a batch of frames to determine if talking behavior is present.
- The `adjust_focus(frame, talking)` function applies visual effects or adjustments to emphasize the speaker in the frame.

Please note that the GPT-4 model and transcript analysis functionality in the provided code are simulated and not fully functional. You would need a valid OpenAI API key and a working GPT-4 model to perform transcript analysis.
